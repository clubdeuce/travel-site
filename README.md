## Project Takeaways

As I am primarily a back-end developer, the organization of the CSS/JS and  using Gulp and Webpack to package these assets was the biggest takeaway from this experience. I have prior experience using Gulp, but this project deepened my understanding of the relationships between tasks, and the PostCSS material was totally new to me. I really enjoyed building this project.
